User Stories

As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city. As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less information about an event. As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once. As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I viewed the last time I was online. As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I can open the app faster. As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that I know what events are organized in which city.

Technical Details

A React application. Built using the TDD technique. Uses the Google Calendar API and OAuth2 authentication flow. Uses serverless functions (AWS lambda) for the authorization server instead of using a traditional server. Passes Lighthouseâ€™s PWA checklist. Works offline or in slow network conditions with the help of a service worker. The API calls use React axios and async/await. Implements an alert system using an OOP approach to show information to the user. Makes use of data visualization (recharts preferred).
